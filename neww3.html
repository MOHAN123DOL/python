<div class="about">

	<p>

I am a mechanical engineer who is passionate about using my skills to make a positive impact on the world. I am particularly interested in developing sustainable technologies that can help to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate the effects of climate change.

I have a strong track record of success in product design and development. I have worked on a variety of projects, including the development of a new type of solar panel that is more efficient and less expensive to produce than traditional panels. I have also worked on the design of a new type of electric vehicle that is more affordable and has a longer range than existing models.

In addition to my work in product development, I am also involved in research and innovation. I am currently working on a project to develop a new type of battery that is more energy-dense and has a longer lifespan than traditional batteries. This project has the potential to revolutionize the electric vehicle industry and make electric vehicles more practical and affordable for consumers.

I am also a strong advocate for STEM education. I believe that it is important to encourage young people to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in order to solve the world's most pressing problems. I regularly give talks and workshops at schools and universities to share my passion for engineering and to inspire the next generation of innovators
